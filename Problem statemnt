As a Cyber Security Expert in a multinational organization, I am tasked with monitoring multiple computer systems to ensure their integrity and security. The objective is to design a software solution that can 
effectively manage and monitor these systems by modeling various organizational components and their interactions using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
principles.
The core functionalities of the solution must include:

1. System and Stakeholder Identification: Accurately identify and categorize different types of employee computer systems along with their specific attributes, and model various stakeholders 
(e.g., System Administrators, CEOs) as distinct classes.

2. Access Control and Functionality: Implement a system that demonstrates access control and varying levels of authority among stakeholders. This will involve using inheritance to allow a System Administrator to 
monitor employee activity, while a CEO has the enhanced ability to monitor both employees and system administrators.

3. Polymorphism and Method Behavior: Apply polymorphism to enable different stakeholders to perform the same actions, such as registering new IP addresses, while using method overriding to tailor specific 
behaviors to each stakeholder type (e.g., a CEO’s monitoring capabilities are different from a System Administrator’s).

4. Code Structure and Control Flow: Utilize constructors and constructor overloading for flexible object creation. The system should also incorporate a switch-case structure to manage various operations, 
including registering new IP addresses, displaying system information, and deleting unused systems.

5. Access Modifiers: Correctly apply public, private, and protected access modifiers to ensure proper encapsulation and data protection within the class hierarchy.
